## Overview of Project
In this project we created a web page to display requested UFO information that is stored as a JavaScript array. To make the page fully dynamic we created a table that has the ability to filter the data out based on certain criteria. The web page was created using JavaScript as the primary coding language, and then placed the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

## Results
Our Web page consists of two parts, search filter and head. The top part of our site consists of a description paragraph and a "UFO Sightings" navigation bar that also serves us as a clear filter search option that will take you back to the original default page. The second lower part of the site is the interactive filter search tool and result table that will show input result information as well as the comment for that specific event. The filter search block has five buttons for input that will take any number of inputs at a time:

 - Date
 - City
 - State
 - Country
 - Shape

## Summary

Although our web page looks professional and serves its purpose of displaying information requested, there are a few things we could do to make it even better. One of the drawbacks of the site is the way filter search is displayed. It would look better if we move each input bar underneath the enter. Also, since the data we are pulling information from has only one country of origin, that column can be removed. Lastly, in the original web page we had a “filter” button that ran our search tab that was removed. We could bring that button back, but this time assign it to clear the input so we don’t have to navigate to the navigation bar.
